## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing airline operations by minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency through strategic pathfinding and aircraft selection. The project is divided into three tasks, each addressing different scenarios and challenges.

## Tasks

### Task 1
**Objective:** Identify the most cost-effective aircraft for different scenarios.

**Approach:** Some areas the flight route may encounter may cost extra fuel or time.In order to minimalise the cost, flight planning will consider factors like fuel costs, time-related costs, and operational constraints. After obtaining the flight route with lowest cost,the data obtained will be used to select the best aircraft model.

For flight path planning, we first set up the obstacle map, the start and the end position of the route.

Then, we set up the cost intensive area (fuel intensive, time intensive).

After that, we set the cost value of the area.

Finally, the route can be found.

Then, by calculation, we can find the aircraft type most suitable for the route for different simulation.

### Task 2
**Goal:** Design a new cost area that can reduce the cost of the route by leveraging jet streams.

**Methodology:** Introduce a jet stream area to reduce flight time and fuel consumption, achieving significant cost savings.

### Task 3
**Name for our aircraft:** Genshin 01

**Specifications:**
- Passenger capacity: 250-450
- Engine count: 2-4

**Detailed Calculation:** Calculate operational costs for different passenger capacities to determine the most cost-effective configuration.
