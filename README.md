## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing airline operations by minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency through strategic pathfinding and aircraft selection. The project is divided into three tasks, each addressing different scenarios and challenges.

## Tasks

### Task 1
**Objective:** Identify the most cost-effective aircraft for different scenarios.

**Approach:** Consider factors like fuel costs, time-related costs, and operational constraints to select the best aircraft model.

### Task 2
**Goal:** Design a new cost area that can reduce the cost of the route by leveraging jet streams.

**Methodology:** Introduce a jet stream area to reduce flight time and fuel consumption, achieving significant cost savings.

### Task 3
**Name for our aircraft:** Genshin 01

**Specifications:**
- Passenger capacity: 250-450
- Engine count: 2-4

**Detailed Calculation:** Calculate operational costs for different passenger capacities to determine the most cost-effective configuration.
